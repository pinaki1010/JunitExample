Welcome to the JUnit Example Repository! This repository is designed to provide you with a comprehensive demonstration of JUnit, a popular testing framework for Java applications. Whether you're new to JUnit or looking to brush up on your testing skills, you've come to the right place.

## What is JUnit?

JUnit is a widely-used testing framework for Java applications. It allows developers to write and run automated tests to verify the correctness of their code. With its easy-to-use syntax and powerful features, JUnit simplifies the process of creating and executing tests, helping you catch bugs and ensure the reliability of your software.

## Features of this Repository

- **Example Test Cases:** We have included a variety of example test cases covering different scenarios, including basic assertions, parameterized tests, and exception handling.
- **Mocking and Stubbing:** Explore how to use popular mocking frameworks like Mockito to simulate dependencies and control their behavior during testing.
- **Test Suites:** Learn how to create test suites to group related test cases and run them together, enabling efficient and organized testing.
- **Integration Testing:** Discover how to perform integration testing with JUnit, allowing you to test the interactions between different components of your application.
